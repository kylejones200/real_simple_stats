Tutorial Overview
----------------

Our tutorials are designed to take you from basic concepts to advanced statistical analysis:

**Basic Statistics Tutorial**
    Learn to calculate and interpret descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and more.

**Probability Analysis Tutorial**
    Explore probability calculations, combinations, permutations, and probability distributions.

**Hypothesis Testing Guide**
    Master statistical hypothesis testing including t-tests, confidence intervals, and p-values.

**Data Visualization Tutorial**
    Create meaningful statistical plots and charts to visualize your data.

Getting Started
--------------

Each tutorial includes:

* **Learning objectives** - What you'll learn
* **Prerequisites** - What you need to know first
* **Step-by-step examples** - Hands-on practice
* **Real-world applications** - How to apply the concepts
* **Practice exercises** - Test your understanding

Before You Begin
---------------

Make sure you have Real Simple Stats installed::

    pip install real-simple-stats

For the tutorials, you might also want to install Jupyter::

    pip install jupyter

Then you can run the example notebooks::

    jupyter notebook examples/getting_started.ipynb

Tutorial Data
------------

Most tutorials use sample datasets that are either:

* **Built into the examples** - Small datasets for learning
* **Publicly available** - Real-world data you can download
* **Generated programmatically** - Synthetic data for specific scenarios

Next Steps
---------

1. **Start with Basic Statistics** if you're new to statistics
2. **Jump to specific topics** if you have experience
3. **Try the examples** in your own Python environment
4. **Modify the code** to work with your own data
